# Editing Review Checklist

## 1. Story Engagement
- Review the original footage for a story structure. Identify any segments that are long, repetitive, or dull.
- Re-represent the story in a more engaging and compelling manner using creative edits.

## 2. Essential Content
- Ensure no important events, thoughts, or pieces of information are left out.
- Verify that all key aspects are present in the edited story.

## 3. Thought & Event Flow
- Complete thoughts, events, and ideas with a clear introduction and conclusion.
- Avoid trimming the start or cutting too soon, which may omit the conclusion of any thought or event.

## 4. Precise Cuts
- Make cuts at the end of a word or sentence. Avoid cutting off words or splitting them, which would make the dialogue sound awkward.
- Be mindful when cutting to ensure no part of a word is removed at the start of a clip.

## 5. Repetition Removal
- Check for and remove repetitive information, events, or thoughts that do not add value to the story.

## 6. Clip Gaps & Space Management
- Do not leave unnecessary space at the end of a clip unless showing a facial reaction or expression necessary for context.
- Avoid blank spaces at the beginning of clips unless it is crucial for context or storytelling.

## 7. Muted Audio Handling
- Cover muted sections with the same background noise from the location of the muted segment.
- Ensure the added background noise is consistent and smooth to maintain the scene's natural sound.
